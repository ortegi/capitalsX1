# capitalsX1 :grinning: üåç 

CapitalsX1 is a  trivia game where the user has the posibility of selecting a continent , and then, the user is supposed to guess the capital of the country 
randomly selected. 

This small game has been made using vanilla javascript, CSS, HTML, bootstrap, also an API (REST COUNTRIES) to get all the capitals and flags of all countries, to add
a backend i used Firebase so the user could be authenticated with Google. At the end of each game, the user will be able to see other users score.  To do this, i used FIRESTORE. 


i hope you like it.
